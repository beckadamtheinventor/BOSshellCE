    <p><h1>Recognised Headers</h1><br>
    Standard Asm headers, such as icon, description, and language are recognised by BOSshell.
    <h2>Data Structure of BOSshell Headers</h2></p>
    <p>
      The BOSshell file header is a null-terminated string at the beginning of a file.<br>
      There may optionally be a null byte inserted before.<br>
      Any characters less than 0x21 or greater than 0x7F will be treated as ".dat" files.<br>
      The one notable exception to this rule is 0xEF,0x7B. This marks an Assembly program.<br>
