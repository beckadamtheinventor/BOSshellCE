# BOSshellCE
BOSshell for the TI-84+CE graphing calculator, written (mostly) in ICE.
Coming soon to the CE!!

### TODO:
+ running programs
+ file associations
+ user modification of file headers
+ misc bugs and crashes

I've decided to upload the source code for BOSshell so hopefully someone can help me fix some of the issues I'm having, specifically with running programs.
