D02655: tempFreeArc
D0118C: asm_prgm_size

000000h: Start of flash. The first 128 K are locked boot sectors. The first 8 are divided into 8 K sectors, all of which are locked. The certificate is now a single 64 K sector, so I hope you don't crash while rebuilding it.
000066h: Flash exception handler. Write-to-flash without permission triggers the non-maskable interrupt to fire.
00007Eh: Hardware/Emu flag: This byte indicates whether the ROM is a hardware ROM or emulator.
000080h: Start of boot code jump table.
020000h: Start of OS.
0C0000h: Start of user archive.
3B0000h: Certificate.
3C0000h: Temp RAM backup, on newer versions of TIOS debug output is also written here.
3E0000h: Temp RAM backup.
3F0000h: Temp RAM backup, temp certificate backup, swap sector.
400000h: Can be setup to mirror flash, but usually unmapped.
800000h: Always unmapped.
D00000h: Start of RAM. 256 K.
D1A87Eh: Top of the SPL stack.
D1A881h: Start of UserMem.
D40000h: Start of VRAM. 320x240x2 bytes = 153600 bytes.
D65800h: Unmapped memory.
D80000h: Mirror of D00000h.
E00000h: Start of memory-mapped I/O address spaces.
SafeRAM Areas:

D031F6h: pixelShadow - 8400 bytes
D052C6h: pixelShadow2 - 8400 bytes
D07396h: cmdPixelShadow - 8400 bytes
D09466h: plotSScreen - 21945 bytes
D0EA1Fh: saveSScreen - 21945 bytes
Note that the above is contiguous, which provides a total linear free space of 69090 bytes of RAM.
pixelShadow2 is the most stable; and is a viable option for testing TSRs and hooks.
More SafeRAM Areas:

D006C0h: textShadow - 260 bytes
D0232Dh: cmdShadow - 260 bytes
Also, if you do not wish to use the LCD cursor (This is not RAM, but can be used as scrap)

E30800h: cursorImage - 1024 bytes
