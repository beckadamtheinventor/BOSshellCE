ABOUT:
BOSshell stands for Beck's Operational shell. This shell can be used for a number of different file making and processing programs.
This shell supports standard Asm headers, as well as it's own file typing system.
If you do encounter a bug or crash, please report it to me on the dev thread at https://www.cemetech.net/

INSTALLATION:
Transfer "BOSSHELL.tig" to the calculator. (ex. TI-Connect, TILP)
Select "BOSSHELL" from the [prgm] list, then press [enter] to run it.
The shell will load momentarily! :D



USAGE:
When the desktop appears, there will be a cursor, which you can move around with the arrow keys.
Pressing [clear] will exit the shell.
Right-click with [alpha] or [graph] to open the file menu; text will appear in the top left corner.
From there, select a menu option using the left-right arrow keys and [2nd] or [trace].
Each item in this menu does something different.

<new>    create a new file
         This will show a second menu. From there, input a file type then a name for the file.
<open>   open the file, which is hovered over by the cursor
<edit>   edit the file, which is hovered over by the cursor
<copy>   Add file to copy/cut buffer, to be copy->pasted
<paste>  Paste file from copy/cut buffer
         Prompts for a file name. (pasted file name) If the name contains nothing, it will paste the file with the same name as before.
<delete> Delete file. Alternatively you can press [del] (will delete from the calculator)
<cut>    Add file to copy/cut buffer, to be cut->pasted
<import> Add file to filesystem
         Prompts for a file name (file to import)
<remove> Remove selected file from the filesystem
         NOTE: This does not delete nor hide the file from the calculator
<rename> Rename file
         Prompts for a file name (new name)
<info>   Show file info

There is also a secondary menu, opened by pressing [math]:
<open with>  Select a file association to open the selected file with
<edit with>  Select a file association to edit the selected file with
<Run prgm>   Attempt to execute the selected program. This executes it as TI-BASIC if it is not a valid Asm file.


Left-click on the icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and the version info will appear.
Right-click on that icon to open the settings menu.

Click on the double left/right arrows at the bottom of the screen (or use [window]/[zoom] keys) to change the current box number.

Left-click on a file on the desktop and it will take you to its associated editor program.
If it prompts: "File Assoc?", Input the name of the program/appvar of the editor program that you would like to associate with this type of file, then input whether it is an appvar or program.
The shell will then open in the editor that you had selected, and remember your choice.

Press [apps] to bring up a list of all the file associations.
If it doesn't this means that you do not have any file associations.
Once in the menu, you can scroll the list with the up and down arrow keys.
Pressing [del] will remove the currently selected file association.
Pressing [+] will allow you to add a new file association.

Press [prgm] to run a program. It will prompt for a name, then a variable type.



NOTE ON USER INPUT:
Pressing [clear] at any time while inputting anything will cancel the operation


SETTINGS MENU:
<backgd> set background color
<text A> set text color A; used for non-inverted text
<text B> set text color B; used for inverted text background
<text C> set text color C; used for inverted text foreground


TEXT INPUT:
Press [alpha] or [2nd] to switch overtypes
Under the "A" or "a" overtype, use the keys with the green letters above them to put letters
Under the "1" overtype, use the number keys to enter numbers.
See "keymap.txt" for more details.
