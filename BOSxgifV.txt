'xgif' viewer for BOSshell
beckadamtheinventor

This program is built to be run from BOSshell as an external editor, and it cannot be run on it's own.
It will simply return if it is not opened from BOSshell, or if it is run by itself.


If the file has been opened, it will display the image.
If it just returns, the image is empty. Edit the file to add contents.
Press [clear] to return to BOSshell.

If the file is being edited, it will prompt for a sprite set, then for a delay.
At this time, the easiest way to make a sprite set is to use TileMapE (beckadamtheinventor) and export the tileset.
The delay (in milliseconds) is the delay between frames.
