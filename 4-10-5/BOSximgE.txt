beckadamtheinventor

This program is built to be run from BOSshell as an external editor, and it cannot be run on it's own.
It will simply return if it is not opened from BOSshell, or if it is run by itself.

This program will open the image for editing regardless of whether it has been opened or being edited.


KEYS:
arrows: move cursor
[clear]: return to BOSshell
[mode]: save image
[2nd]/[enter]: put pixel color at cursor
[alpha]: get pixel color at cursor
[mode]: change current color
[y=]: fill rectangle with current color. Press once at point A, then press it again at point B to fill a rectangle.
[window]: replace color at cursor with current color

NOTES:
This program does not autosave, press [mode] to save.
Pressing [clear] does not save, just returns to BOSshell.
